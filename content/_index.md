        Generative Models x Visual Neuroscience
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        I'm a research fellow at Kempner Institute for the Study of Natural and Artificial Intelligence at Harvard University, 
        
        I work at the intersection of generative model and visual neuroscience -- generating images from the brain, and dissecting how generative models actually work. I combine theory and experiments, with a toolkit spanning geometry, interpretability, and optimization. 

        I blog about deep learning, math and neuroscience.
