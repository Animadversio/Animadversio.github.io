# Note on StyleGAN 1 and 2



## Adaptive Instance Normalization

Actually BigGAN has some similar design with this. 

## StyleBlock 



## Mapping Network

Mapping Network warp the input Normal distribution into a more complex manifold. Both ease sampling with a Gaussian distribution and facilitate complex distribution as input. 



## Truncation Trick

Truncation trick has been used in BigGAN in latent space directly, here they use truncation trick in $w$ space instead of $z$ space.
