# Motivation

Generating and rendering random shapes may be of interest to visual coding experiment or computer vision. 

In this note we introduce a few easy way to generate smooth "random" objects from `matlab`. 



# IsoSurface of Filtered Noise 

## Theory

Theory behind this method is [Morse Theory]() in the essence, i.e. if we define a function in $f:\R^3\mapsto\R$ , and find the inverse image of one value $f^{-1}(a)$
