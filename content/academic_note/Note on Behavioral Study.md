Note on Behavioral Study
======





# History of Behavioral Science

Two historical trends of study combines into modern comparative cognition / behavioral science study. 

## Comparative Psychology 

More in context of psychology: 

* Athropocentric

* Behaviorism
  * Believing 
  * Behavior > mind. Attribute causation to outside world not inside
  * All learning Through Conditioning
* General Process Approach: Universal processes to all animals
* Study behavior in artificial setting / artificial tasks
* Focus on few model specie, not very comparative across phylogenetic tree! 



**Classical Conditioning** 

**Associative Learning** Associate CS with US, so that CS can elicit the UR just as US. 



**Operant Conditioning** 

* Reinforcement: increase the frequency of behavior
  * Positive Reinforcement: Add Reward
  * Negative Reinforcement: Relieve Punishment
* Punishment: decrease behavior 



Can be combined in a clever way! Can be really complex



## Ethology 

More in context of biology: 

* Focus on: Anatomy, physiology, environment, evolution
* Descendent of *Natural history* and *Ecology* 
* Innate and hard wired  behavior: 
* Study in natural environment and adaptive behavior! 

### Tinberrgen's 4 Questions

**Tinberrgen's 4 Questions**: Why X exhibit Y behavior? 

* Causation (Proximal cause / Mechanism / Neuro Circuit / Physiology):
* Development (ontogeny): 
* Evolution (phylogeny): 
* Function (Adaptive significance / value for the animal): How it helps survival and reproduction

How and Why? Proximal reason and Ultimate reason!

**Note**: Answer one of these questions don't answer other questions, not exclusive. Multiple explanations for the same behavior. 

### Fixed Action Patterns

**Fixed Action Patterns**: Classical concept from Ethology. Useful as a baseline model of behavior, but obsolete. 

* Stereotypic Motor Sequence
* Innate, quite specie-specific
* Triggered by a *sign* stimulus, but not like reflex! 
  * **Releasers**: 
* Run to completion
  * *Hard to define completion*
* Need no sensory feedback 



**Ethogram**: Full behavior repertoire and the transition probability in it 

**Examples** 

* Social behavior can be a interwined FAPs
* Motivation can affect probability of FAP
* Conditioning can associate FAP with other releaser ...



## Modern Comparative Cognition 

* Focus on **information processing**: 
  * Perception, Attention, Memory, Learning, Problem Solving, Decision making, Communication.
  * How information 
    * gets in, gets processed, (Perception & Attention)
    * gets stored, (Memory)
    * changes the inner representation and associate with other things (Learning)
    * gets used to guide behavior output (Decision)
    * transmitted between individuals (communication)

**Philosophy** 

* Study each species from its own perspective, specialization
* Evolutionary context + adaptive behavior
* Study species across phylogenetic tree, and compare explicitly! 
* Choose natural behavior and species that suggest interesting cognition behind! 



### Methodology

* Use behavior as **proxy** for cognition
  * However, no behavior doesn't mean no inner process. No Equivalence!

**Lesson**: Use easy quantifiable natural behavior, use training / conditioning to motivate! 

* Training / Conditioning to solve the motivation / variability problem! 

**Caveat** 

* **Story of Clever Hans**! Expectancy effect influence behavior, even if human doesn't notice his expectation! 



# Evolution and Cognition

Tackles the ultimate questions in [4 questions](#Tinberrgen's 4 Questions)! 



Different level of biological evolution

* Genotypic evolution 
* Phenotypic evolution

**Note**: Current animals are not evolving into each other, we are nodes.(老鼠 猫 猴子不会相互进化)



**Darwinian Evolution**: The mechanism 

* Overproduction





## Evolution and Brain

Brain structure share similarity among 

### Flexibility of Brain

* Neural modulatory system, affecting the behavioral pattern (motivation, inner state)
* Activity dependent plasticity (development, learning)



# Learning 





## General Process Learning Theory 

* Majorly involve Classical + Operant Conditioning 



* It's not appropriate to compare learning speed across species
  * They learn what they need! 



* 
  * Autoshaping: start a process that is innate behavior 
  * Conditioned Food Aversion: Very long temporal delay, not 
  * Imprinting 
  * Song Learns: Not classical not operant



## Why Learning Evolves? 

* Learning is based on environment regularity but not totally fixed! 
* Q: What's good for a learnt behavior VS innate behavior



## Questions on Learning

* Contents of Learning
  * 
* Conpact on behavior



**Note**: Behavioralism doesn't distinguish contents and behavior!! 



**Example**: Bees are really good learner of sensory information (Color Odor Shape), and remember that, integrate that with 



### Test Classical Conditioning







* 
* Control for Non-associative Learning ! 
  * Make one stimuli unpredictive of learning ! 
  * Unpair CS and US
