# Note on Animal Perception

From lecture of Science of Behavior

> What does it feel to be a bat!? 

* **Umwelt**: the sensory world of an animal, can be very different from ours.
  * Different precision, range ...
  * Use same modality in different ways: Sound Imaging
  * Electro-/Magneto-reception



> "More extreme your claim, stronger your evidence!"



**How to define a novel sensory system in animal? **

* Receptor
* Anatomical connnections to CNS
* Stimulus responsive neuron in CNS ()
* Behavior related to the stimuli
* Necissity (Lesion study)



## Example: Electro Reception

The neurons response for multiple things: Heat, Chemicals, Mechanics! But it's actually electroreception! 

* Actually, mechanoreceptor and electroreceptor can be activated by mechanical stimuli / optical stimuli both! 
  * The sensory modalities that are Maximally sensitive !



**Why use Electroreception?**: 

* Living Fish generates electric field! (Dead fish don't)
* Water is really conductive to electricity! 



**Behavior Mediated by Eletroreception**

* Find prey under the sand (or in Agar )





## Example: Magneto Reception

**Mechanism of Large Scale Navigation**

* Example:
  * Homing Pigeon (extreme case): Half a world away, he can find precise location! 

* **Map and Campass Hypothesis**: Normally needs 2 parts to navigate! 
  * Map: Where the target is! Where I am?
  * Compass: What is that direction (relative to me)! 
  * *Note*: Or can we combine the 2 thing? 



For a super long distance navigation animal, the campus and map should be available globally and naturally (Geographic knowledge)! **Potential options** 

* Sun light + **circadian time info** 
  * Note Sun + Time =>Direction, Sun + Direction => Time, without internal clock. The animal will get dis-oriented. 

* Magnetic field / Electric field
* Sea stream
* Wind? 



* Check if they use Sun direction?
  * Experiment: Mess with internal clock! (jet lags)
* Check if they use Magnetic field for direction?
  * Experiment: Mess with magnetic field! (magnet on his body)
  * **Result**: So Magneto perception is not necessary, but is an alternative of Sun location! 
    * In Cloudy days, they lost! 
    * In Sunny days, the magnetic pigeons are fine



**Magetic field as the loaction information**:

* Magnetic field 
  * There are metamers for magnetic field! How they 
  * Magnetic field can 

**Sea Turtle Lifelong Navigation**

* Manipulate magnetic field, see where they swim towards!
* 





Use natural behavior! Just change the environment, see the behavioral change! Simplidied the natural behavior / environment

Manipulate natural 





## How a *de novo* sensory system evolve! 

Neural plasticity is super-important for this chick and egg problem!

* With new types of signal comes in
* The circuit will learn to process it! Associate its inner representation with useful things! 
  * The monkey with a new type of cone can see the world in 3 color !! 
  * How it process it! 





Right Eye and Left eye projection and processing! 



## Psychophysics (physiology )

**Next level more refine question**: (Not can they detect) But how physical property translates into perceptual quantities. 

* Intensity ~ Loudness
* Absolute threshold
* Relative threshold
* Scaling: 
  * Usually about intensity not other things
* Tuning





Doing psychophysics in animals requires training! 



### Habituation and De-habituation

Definition: 

Habituation is a good way to test animal can tell the difference

~ related to receptor desensitization

### Background Contrast

* Camouflage & Aposematism



# Recognition Learning
