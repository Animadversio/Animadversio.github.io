## Alignment of Objective in Evolution

If there is a creator that kick start the Evolution, what is the objective that he has in mind?

Maybe self preservation and reproduction are two of them. He is super successful in using these objectives to drive the changes in species. We are becoming adaptive and flexible in the history of nature. 

But one thing to note is that, the objectives we have in mind are quite different from what creator thinks about. We desire for career for meaning for love and relationship, for money and social status. But we don't really care about genes and their reproduction. 

Similarly, the agents created by reinforcement learning algorithms may care about some strange things, but they are still evolved or optimized to reach the goal we are hoping for, but, without knowing it.
