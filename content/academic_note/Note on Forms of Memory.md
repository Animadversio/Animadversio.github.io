# Note on Forms of Memory

Definition pin down can be very tricky! 

**Definition**

* Retaining, retrieving, using information after the original information (stimuli) does not present. (Inner view)
* Any process that some past experience has an effect on the way the subject think and behave in the future. (Outer View)
  * Thus can generalize into even non-animated things! *Memory of magnet*

## Use of Memory

* Longterm Memory
  * Human: Remember things relevant for life. (name, pw, birthday, info about others, address, knowledge)
  * Ecological: cache for food, foraging location. 
* Shorterm Memory
  * Continuity of awareness

## Different forms

Memory has many forms. 

* Sensory memory
* Short-term memory / Working Memory
* Long term memory
  * Episodic memory (experience from past, sensory)
  * Semantic memory (facts in verbal sense, abstract)
  * Procedural memory (how to do something, motor)

### Modal Model

* Strucutral features: Where / in what form information resides, 
* Control processes: How we manipulate information
  * E.g. Encoding, retrieval, rehearsal. 

**Remark**

* Very computer like! Input-Output <-> Short Memory <-> Disk
* STM is too simple! Obsolete in modern research! 
  * Doesn't need to get into STM to be stored in Long term memory
  * ST and LT is too phenomenological no specific mechanism
* Human CogPsych literature is quite different from animal literature, human literature is more dichotomy



**Distinction in neural term**

* **Transient**
  * Persistence of firing: Recurrent network firing patterns
  * Short term synaptic / cellular change, can memorize things without firing. 
* **Permanent** 
  * Very long term synaptic change 

## Sensory Memory

Very short term, < 1 sec

* Visual persistence (Iconic memory)
* Auditory persitence (Echoic memory)

**Application**

* Movie, moving picture
* Sparkling trace! 
* Extract information from the persistence 

### Classic Exp on Capacity and Duration of Sensory Memory

**Experiment**: Sperling's visual memory experiment 

* **Whole report**: Baseline, test how much he can report
* **Partial report** : To test if they have access to the sensory data
  * No limit of capacity! 
* **Delay partial report** : To test how long they have access to the sensory data
  * If cue come later, the memory trace may decay away. 



**Understanding**

* Majorly it's the persistence of neural activity (time constant is not infinitely short, so it reflects precision of time integration.)
  * Time constant of visual cortices firing determined by some recurrent or biophysics (single cell excitability)
  * Can be after effect 
  * Thus, visual features can cause the difference in persistence time! 
* Masking can disrupt the sensory persistence
* Pre-categorization (stimuli without name / verbal memory)
* Quite unlimited in capacity

## Short-term Memory

* Awareness, window to present

* believed to last 15-30s
* Capacity is limited, in psycho unit (chunk)
* Items are processed in some way. Features matter! 

### Experiment: Brown Peterson task

Original working memory task, later it is called STM later. 

* **Exp**:  Remember 3 words / consonants, then counting down a number to avoid rehearsal 
* **Result**: Observe the recall probability decay through time! 





### Experiment: Change detection. 

* At first, feature / conjunction features (add size shape color ...) doesn't affect the change detection performance ! 
* But complex objects like character .... are harder at change detection! (maybe encoding problem)





### Chunking

Memorizing 3 letter vs words, a word is easier than all letters. 

**Note**: 

* The capacity of working memory $7\pm 2$ 
* Modern estimate is lower! 



**Note**: Champions in memory usually use association & chunking to alleviate the memory load! 






## Working Memory

**Baddeley model**: 

* Phonological loop
* Visuospatial sketch pad 
* Central Executive 

( Differentiate between the auditory part and visual part, maybe more! )

Exp can show, the visual and auditory memory doesn,t interfere that much ! 



### Phonological Loop

**Word length effect** : If a word is faster to reproduce, we can remeber more of them!! Disrupt rehearsal, disrupt this effect



**Mind rotation**: Operation time correlates with the angle



### Event Model and Memory

Change in events / environment / scene may flush the memory cache

## Neural Correlates of Working Memory

PFC has persistent activity during working memory retention period.

Hippocampus is also important





## Long term Memory

Long term memory has many form. 

* Explicit (Declarative)
  * Semantic (knowledge, facts)
  * Episodic (experience, sensory)
  * Autobiographic
* Implicit
  * Procedural memory 
  * Priming
  * Conditioning

**Classical study** 

To distinguish longterm from shorterm memory is serial position curve in sequence memory. 

## Implicit Longterm Memory

Experimentally, implicit memory is hard to be pure! 

### Procedural Learning

> Practise makes perfect. 

Common in life, include but not restricted to motor learning. 

* Perform an action sequence (violin, piano)
* Novel visual processing,like mirror reading, writing. 

* Cog control task learning 

Speeding up over time! Automization.

* At first, it's visual processing, and it become retrival afterward. 
* 



### Priming

Presenting stimuli affects how it is processed later! 

Even if you are not tasked to remember something, exposure to the item will help you.
