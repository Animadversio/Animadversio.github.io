Note on Selective Attention
======
From 

1. Christofer Koch 2013 Lecture Visual Attention and Consciousness
2. Goldstein, Chapter Attention



In nature language Attention refers to a family of abilities

* Vigilance / overall attention
* Selective attention: processing sth in the cost of others
* Distributed attention
  * Automaticity (action / perception task that does not take capacity)

**Selective attention** is different from general attention ---- arousal. 

* Has capacity, comes with a cost. It's selective! 





**Note**: Tracking eye / pupil size can help judge the attention level! 

- Very large effect! Can be used to judge attention base on few trials. 

## Phenomenal Models

### Resources allocation model

- Several Components
  - Arousal ~ Attention Capacity 
  - Allocation Policy 
    - What decides where gets attention: Spatial / Feature / Temporal 
  - Possible Allocation targets 



### Filter Model: Early Filter/Attenuator/ Late Filter

**Experiment**: Dual channel sentence input -> attend to one of them 

* Un-attended message / signal is attenuated / filter out at early stage! 
* But stimulus saliency / system's default gain also matters
  *  "Your own name" and some alert message is very salient!!
* However, some information can get through, masking channel can get attended to if it's salient enough





### Feature Integration Theory

**Model** 

* Visual system analyze the images into features (Pre-attentive stage)
* Then featues get integrated binded into objects. 
* Binding depends on 
  * Saliency, Guidance, Attention! 

**Visual Search Task**: 

* Single feature search: search time invariant to object number
* Multi feature conjunction search: Scale linearly to object number
* But saliency, subtelity of difference affects the speed! 



## Selective Attention

* Bottom Up Attention “Catch your eye ball”
  * Sometimes called Saliency! 
  * There is good [algorithm](http://www.saliencytoolbox.net/publications.html) to calculate / simulate saliency
    * Even commercialized! Really important for Advertisement and Printing industry.  
* Top Down Attention : Flexible and task dependent
  * Spatial based attention; 
  * Feature based attention: Very interesting phenomenon
  * Object form based attention
    * Strong effect! Even when object cued is moving, there is still cuing based facilitation. 
    * **NOTE**: OBJECT based attention can be used to CHECK what the subject judge as one WHOLE OBJECT! 
    * Kanisza Rectangle...



**Experiment**: Posner's task 

* **Visual Cueing**: Cue is used to manipulate attention! 

* Exognenous Cue
  * Fast (SOA for effect)
  * Coming from saliency of the object 
  * ~ Superior Colliculus
* Endogenous Cue
  * Slow (SOA for effect)
  * Depending on interpretation, can learn and adapt depending on the predictability! 





### Brain Substrate

**Related Brain Regions** (in *primates*): Seems attention and eye movement is closely related! 

* FEF (Frontal Eye Field), LIP (Lateral Infero Parietal), V4, SC (Superior Colliculus), Pulvinar

**Remark**: 

* Eye movement vs Selective attention ~ Overt attention vs Covert attention



**Neural effects of Attention**

* In V1, attention increases the Gain and/or Baseline firing rate in a retinotopy measure
  * Effect in Bias towards detection.
  * (2009). I know where you are secretly attending! The topography of human visual attention revealed with fMRI. Vision Research







### When Attention Fails

**Attention Related Error** (a.k.a. **Inattentional Blindness**)

* Inattentional Blindness [Invisible ]
* Discontinuity Error: [Simons and Levin 1998](https://vimeo.com/81039224)
  * When we attend to something, we ignore some major change in the figure!! 
  * By some minor features we identify the object/ person is the same person and begin to do something else! But they are not the same person. 
  * We can catch the "Gist" / "theme" quite easily, but specific visual features many cases elude our attention
* **Application**
  * For Driving: It's the attention loss that most detrimental to calling / texting during driving! 
  * **Attention manipulation** is the core trick for all magicians. 
  * Can be used by Movie directors and Visual Effects Artists.
