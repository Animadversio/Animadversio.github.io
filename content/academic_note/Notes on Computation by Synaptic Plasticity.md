# Note on Computation by Biological Plausible Learning
from lecture of Cengiz Penleven 2019


# Philosophy
Neural dynamics can be a substrate of computation. The neural dynamics and plasticity dynamics can both do optimization, and the biological constraint form a source of constraint on variables. 

For a dynamic system, if it has an Lyapnov function, then the dynamics can do some mimization / maximization. 

The biological plausibility means the plascity happens on local site, requires information that are only local. 

## PCA from Hebbian Learning
Simplest implementation of Hebbian Learning is just as 

$$
W_{ij}\leftarrow W_{ij}+y_ix_j
$$

Essentially, it's doing 



## multi-PC PCA from Hebbian anti-Hebbian Learning



## Similarity Matching (classical MDS) from Hebbian anti-Hebbian Learning




## Sparse coding
