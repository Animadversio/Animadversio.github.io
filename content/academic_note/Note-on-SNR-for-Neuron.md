## Motivation

It's well known that the neurons are noisy signal transmitter, but to measure how noisy they are we need some statistics to do so. 



## Classic SNR Definition

SNR is typically defined in a linear Gaussian system. 

Literally SNR is 
$$
SNR ={\sigma_{signal}^2\over\sigma_{noise}^2}
$$

## SNR for Point Process

Maximum likelihood estimate of the linear coefficients is the same as minimizing residue Deviance. (c.f. minimizing squared residue in Gaussian linear model.)



## Connection to Common Statistics

### F Statistics

In ANOVA, F statistics is used to test if the variables are significantly modulating the response. 



### Likelihood Ratio





### R square
