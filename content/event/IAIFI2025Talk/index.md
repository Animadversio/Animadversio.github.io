summary: Analytical Theory of Spectral Effects in Sampling and Learning of Diffusion Model
abstract: 'Diffusion models generate complex data by estimating the score—the gradient of the log-density—across varying noise scales, but the relationship between the learned neural score and the true data score has remained unclear. For moderate-to-high noise levels, the learned score is dominated by its linear (Gaussian) component, enabling a closed-form integration of the probability-flow ODE. This analytical solution predicts key sampling phenomena including the early specification of coarse structures (e.g., scene layouts), the low dimensionality of sampling trajectories, and their sensitivity to perturbations.'

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Hugo Blox Builder's [_Slides_](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/content-types/) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/markdown/).

Further event details, including [page elements](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/markdown/) such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page. -->
